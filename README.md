## üß≠ Overview

This project analyzes and models **daily Divvy bike usage in Chicago**, incorporating weather features to better understand rider behavior. Using Facebook Prophet with external regressors, the model captures seasonal and holiday trends and evaluates predictive performance using residual diagnostics.

---

## üß™ Technologies

- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** `prophet`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `statsmodels`
- **Models:** Prophet with additive & multiplicative seasonalities and weather covariates

---

## ‚ùì Research Questions

- How do temperature, precipitation, and visibility affect daily bike usage?
- Are weekends and holidays associated with higher or lower ride volumes?
- Can we identify consistent seasonal patterns in bike-sharing activity?
- Does the Prophet model adequately capture these dynamics?
- What is the typical range of prediction error (MAE, RMSE, MAPE)?

---

## üìä Dataset

- **Divvy Bike Data:** [Divvy System Data](https://divvybikes.com/system-data)
- **Weather Data:** [Visual Crossing Weather API](https://www.visualcrossing.com/resources/documentation/weather-data/getting-started-with-weather-data-services/)
- **Frequency:** Daily
- **Time Frame:** 2023‚Äì2024
- **Variables:** 
  - Target: Daily casual and member rides
  - Regressors: `feelslike`, `cloudcover`, `precipcover`, `snowdepth`, `visibility`

---

## üß† Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation
- Merging bike data with daily weather observations
- Missing value handling and alignment
- Train/test split for final 30-day evaluation

### 2. Exploratory Analysis
- Time series plots, histogram, Q-Q plot, rolling statistics
- Visual analysis of variance and seasonality

### 3. Model Building with Prophet
- Regressors: `feelslike`, `cloudcover`, `precipcover`, `snowdepth`, `visibility`
- Tuned parameters: `changepoint_prior_scale`, `seasonality_prior_scale`
- Custom weekly seasonality added (Fourier order = 5 or 7)

### 4. Diagnostics and Evaluation
- ACF & PACF of residuals
- Ljung-Box test for autocorrelation
- One-sample t-test for residual mean = 0
- Metrics: MAE, RMSE, MAPE
